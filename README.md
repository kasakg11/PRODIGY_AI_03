Markov Chain Text Generation
📌 Overview
This project implements a Markov Chain-based text generator in Python. It takes a corpus of text, learns word transitions, and generates new text based on probability.

🛠 Features
N-gram Model: Supports different state_size values (bigram, trigram, etc.)

Randomized Text Generation: Produces unique text each time

Probability-Based Word Selection: More frequent words appear more often

Handles Missing States Gracefully to prevent infinite loops

🚀 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/markov-text-generator.git
cd markov-text-generator
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Run the Model
python generate.py
📌 How It Works
Training Phase:

The script reads input text and creates a dictionary mapping word sequences to possible next words.

Example:

{
  "An apple": ["is"],
  "apple is": ["very"],
  "is very": ["good", "bad"]
}
Text Generation:

Starts with a random word sequence.

Chooses the next word based on learned probabilities.

Continues until the desired length is reached.

📖 Usage
Modify generate.py with:

model.train("your_text.txt", state_size=2)
print(model.generate(length=50))
🛠 Troubleshooting & Fixes
✅ Avoiding Infinite Loops: If a state has no next word, the script restarts with a new state. ✅ Handling Empty Corpus: Ensure the input text is large enough for training. ✅ Index Errors: Proper checks prevent out-of-bounds slicing.
